Know Your Vote Application


This application was built with the purpose of providing a user's (input based) source for political information such as voting candidates, polling locations, and current representives.  

When the user opens the application, they are taken to the index page where the site objectives are located and a link to proceed forward is provided for further information.

On the polling page the user can begin to enter their address to obtain personalize information. Clicking on the address bar will immediately ask for geolocation permission in order to personalize their request. Then, their address is used to feed the Maps and Civic Info API's for further information requests regarding: 

-Polling Location
-Early Voting
-Candidates on Ballot
-Current Representantives

A second row with the related information appears when each link is chosen.

The polling information contains the election name and the date the election occurs, displays a map and a pin that allows the user to locate their designated polling location based on their home address, nearest voting location in accordance with thier home address, and a section that states the polling location name and hours.

The early voting information provides the user with information pertaining to early voting: location, days, and hours. 

The candidate information presents each cardidate in a card. The cards are sorted by office and party. The card color is related to their party affiliation.

The representative information presents current office holders, their photo, and a URL for further information.
